- Some points suchas nav-bar needed to fix. This idea is from Vishisorn W. (Scrum master)         
- Something from service-site are TBA for vaccine-site and walk-in.
- Some UI idea here look too complex such as background for every page except main. (Narawish S.)
- Some page like walk-in and vaccine site can merge together. (Scrum master and not sure that Metaras C. or someone impiled this point too.)
